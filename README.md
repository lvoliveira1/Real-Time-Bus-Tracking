# Real-Time-Bus-Tracking
## This is a useful link on how to build an api application that uses a map, and make it simply running through your screen.
This is an exercise to learn how to use a map and grab some api requests like a map, or some coordinates from MBTA to show the real time the bus cross some areas of the city, accordingly to how we treat the data we grab.
## Future improvements
Make sure your bus can make some api calls and show the position it is in real time.
